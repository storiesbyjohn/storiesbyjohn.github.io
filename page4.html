      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After right after Jackson and Owen sat down, in walked Mr. Jennings.  “Well hello boys.  
	    Now what can I do for you?”  Owen said “it’s this old scroll of paper I found today “ as he handed it to Mr. Jennings.

	Mr. Jennings carefully looked it over.  “It appears to be written in English round hand with a quill dip pen.” 
	    “Hmm, now this is interesting, it says  ‘Those who gaze upon this scroll with scare crow looking down, and say 
	    aloud the ancient words with no one else around, shall travel to and fro in time of Hallows Eve at night, 
	    when the moon is full above the fields of corn and stars shine bright’ “
</i></p>
	<p style="font-size:30px;"><i> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Scarecrow bring thee back in time to ’85 I go, 
		and with those words I now commence my travels to and fro.  
		Hexus Abrexus, Travartus and Gruul, teacheth a lesson I shant learn in school!”

	“Well boys, there you have it.  At last, that’s what the scroll says.” 
		Said Mr. Jennings.  “Now, whether it really works, that’s another matter entirely. 
		Maybe you should leave it with me so I can study it more.  Stay here and I’ll go get a folder to keep it in.”

     <p style="font-size:30px;"><i>But as soon as Mr. Jennings left the room, Owen looked at Jack and 
	     said “C’mon and let’s go!” “Grab the scroll and let’s get out of here.”

	So Jack grabbed the scroll off of Mr. Jenning’s desk and they both ran out of the 
	     building and down to a group of trees in the park.  There, Jackson and Owen talked 
	     about what they should do next.  “Why don’t we plan to hide out in the Jennings farm cornfield on 
	     Halloween night and see if what the scroll says really comes true?” “I’ll do it if you will” said Jack. 
	     So now they began to make their plan.

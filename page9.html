	    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbspThen they stood up and began to walk over to a nearby farmhouse.  As they walked over, 
	    the sound of the cows mooing could be heard from inside the barn.
	    Jack and Owen quietly walked up to the open door of the barn and poked their heads in.  
	    There they saw a boy who appeared to be around the same age as they were.  
	    The boy was milking one of the cows.
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But they Jackson stepped onto a tiny twig that 
	    snapped and the boy turned around to see Owen and Jackson staring back at him 
	    “Hey there” he said as he turned back around to keep milking the cow.  “Hey” said Owen.  
	    “I’m Owen and this here’s Jackson.”  “I’m Atticus, Atticus Jennings” said the boy as he finished his milking.  
	    “Hi Atticus” said Owen.  “Can you tell us exactly where we are right now?”  Owen continued,
	    “You see, Jack and I are from the year 2023 and we travelled back in time, if you can believe it, 
	    and we’re not sure where we are or even what year it is!”
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Atticus just stared at Owen and then let out a loud laugh.  
		But as he slowly stopped laughing, he could see that both the boys were not kidding. And as Atticus 
		looked them over more carefully, He realized that the strange clothing they were wearing was vary, 
		vary different than what he was used to seeing on the other kids from nearby farms.  
		And the only clothes he wore were homespun by his mother from wool and cotton.  
		These boys had colored clothing with words on it!

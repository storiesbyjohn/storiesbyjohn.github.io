      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the hour grew late and approached midnight, 
	    Owen quietly snuck out of his house and started to run over to Jennings Farm.  
	    And Jackson did the same.  “Jackson!” said Owen. “I’m over here!”
	Looking out over the moonlit cornfield, Jackson could see Owen waving his arm.  
	    Jack ran through the stalks of corn and met up with Owen.  Together they found the 
	    scarecrow and sat down in front of it.  “Are you ready to do this?” asked a somewhat nervous Jack.  
	    “I am if you are” said a somewhat nervous Owen.  Looking up at the scarecrow – with the full 
	    moon above it – Owen and Jackson felt a momentary shudder of fear, but both boys pressed on, 
	    even when it seemed that the scarecrows head had begun to look down at their faces!

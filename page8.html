      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   And so began the time travelling journey of Owen and Jackson.  
	    But what neither boy knew was that they were not travelling to the year they originally thought they were going to!

	You see, Owen had heard his mom and dad talking to their friends about the 1980’s, so that’s the year that he was expecting to go to.  However, Owen and Jackson were not traveling to the 1980’s, nor were they travelling back to the 1880’s.  But they were travelling back in time to the 1780’s.  And more specifically, back to the year 1785!  The year that Jennings Farm had begun!

	Now the wind had stopped blowing.  The sun shone bright amongst the rolling hills and valleys of wherever they now were.  “But where were they?” each boy asked each other.  Then they stood up and began to walk over to a nearby farmhouse.  As they walked over, the sound of the cows mooing could be heard from inside the barn.

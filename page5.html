      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   There, Jackson and Owen talked about what they should do next.  
	    “Why don’t we plan to hide out in the Jennings farm cornfield on Halloween night and see if what 
	    the scroll says really comes true?” “I’ll do it if you will” said Jack. So now they began to make their plan.

 	“Here’s what we will do” said Owen.  “after we get home from walking around our neighborhoods, 
	    we can creep out our bedroom windows and meet up at Jennings Farm right before midnight.  
	    Then we can use the moonlight to find our place at the foot of the scarecrow.”  “Ok” said Jack.

		came home from Treat of Treating, he said good night and slowly closed the bedroom door, 
		waiting for the right time to climb down from the window and make his way to the Jennings Farm.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As the sun rose higher in the sky, it began to get very hot.  
	    And both boys were soon sweating more than they ever had.  
	    “Grab a plow and strap it onto a horse and let’s plow all the soil in the garden.  
	    Just watch what I do!” said Atticus.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Jackson and Owen approached the garden, all they could see was what looked like miles of brown dirt.  
	    “This is a garden?” they thought. And Atticus seemed to read their mind.  “Yup.  So let’s get to work.”<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Owen and Jackson hitched up a plow to a horse, then they spread out the hog waste as far as they could 
	    across the garden field, and began to plow the land.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the day kept growing hotter, both boys kept plowing…and plowing…and plowing.  Growing thirsty, 
	    Owen asked Atticus “Can I get a drink of water?”  “Sure can” said Atticus.  “Go over to the well next 
	    to the barn and fetch a bucket of water.  Use the ladle tied to the bucket.  Then fetch another bucket of 
	    water for Jack and I.  And don’t forget to bring the ladle with you!”<br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As the sun rose higher in the sky, it began to get very hot.  
	    And both boys were soon sweating more than they ever had.  
	    “Grab a plow and strap it onto a horse and let’s plow all the soil in the garden.  
	    Just watch what I do!” said Atticus.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Jackson and Owen approached the garden, all they could see was what looked like miles of brown dirt.  
	    “This is a garden?” they thought. And Atticus seemed to read their mind.  “Yup.  So let’s get to work.”<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Owen and Jackson hitched up a plow to a horse, then they spread out the hog waste as far as they could 
	    across the garden field, and began to plow the land.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the day kept growing hotter, both boys kept plowing…and plowing…and plowing.  Growing thirsty, 
	    Owen asked Atticus “Can I get a drink of water?”  “Sure can” said Atticus.  “Go over to the well next 
	    to the barn and fetch a bucket of water.  Use the ladle tied to the bucket.  Then fetch another bucket of 
	    water for Jack and I.  And don’t forget to bring the ladle with you!”<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Owen walked over to the well, lowered the wooden bucket, and raised it back up.  
	    The bucket was heavy with cool, clean well water.  Owen grabbed the ladle and drank the water in a big gulp.  
	    Then he filled up another bucket and walked it over to Atticus and Jackson and they gulped down ladle after 
	    ladle of the cool water.<br />

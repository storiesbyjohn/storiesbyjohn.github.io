      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Atticus then said “Okay, now watch what I do.  
	    Take the horse’s hoof in your left hand, and using this tool, pry off the old shoe. 
	    Scrape the hoof clean, get a new shoe and some nails, and tap the new shoe onto the hoof.  
	    And don’t worry, the horse won’t feel a thing!”  At first, Owen didn’t know what to do.  
	    Then Atticus did it for him.  And then Owen went over to Jackson and showed him what to do.  
	    Because neither boy had ever done it before, re-shoeing the horses took a lot longer than it should have, 
	    and everyone was really sweating in the stables.  But after a while they were all done and the horses all 
	    had their new shoes on!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  
	Wiping the sweat from their heads, Atticus told both Jackson and Owen to follow him to the cornfield.  “How far is it?” 
	    Jackson asked.  “Not too far” said Atticus.   “Just about a mile from here.  That’s all.”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

	Owen had slumped down and so did Jackson as they began walking with Atticus.  But as they walked, Owen began asking 
	    questions of Atticus about what life was like for him and his sisters on the farm.  “It’s pretty good, I reckon”  
	    said Atticus.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
“We all help each other.  Whether it’s this farm or another farm, whenever someone needs help, we help.”

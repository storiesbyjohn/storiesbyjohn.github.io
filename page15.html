      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Then Jackson asked, “Where do you get your clothes?  
	    Where do you get your food?  How do you get a house to live in?”  Atticus answered Jack, 
	    “It’s pretty simple.  You make your clothes and boots.  You grow all of your food, and you build your own house.”  
	    “But the important part is that everyone helps everyone else.  When ever someone needs help, you gladly give it.  
	    Because, one day, you’ll need help too!” said Atticus.   And as they approached the cornfield, Jackson spotted a 
	    scarecrow way out in the middle of the field.  “Psst”, said Jackson.  “I think we should try to get back home to our 
	    families tonight and that scarecrow is where we need to do it at, right?”  “You bet!” said Owen.
	    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

	And so, after a few hours of dropping kernels of corn into rows along the cornfield, Owen and Jackson 
	    told Atticus about what they planned to do once it grew dark outside.  “Okay”, said Atticus.  “That makes sense.  
	    But it was sure nice to meet you boys and I really hope that you learned something about what life was like a 
	    long time ago!”  “Oh, we sure did!” said Jack.  “Oh yes we did!” said Owen.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	“Then, let’s walk back to the barn and the horse stalls and I’ll give you something for good luck on your 
	    journey back to your homes and families” said Atticus.  At the horse stall, Atticus grabbed two of the worn 
	    horse shoes that Owen and Jackson had removed from the horses and handed each one to Jack and Owen.  
	    “Keep this as a reminder of where you went and what you learned”, said Atticus.  “Thanks!” said Jack and Owen.  “And thanks for being our friend!”  “Bye” said Atticus as he slowly walked back to the barn.  “And safe travels!”

 “Keep this as a reminder of where you went and what you learned”, said Atticus.  “Thanks!” said Jack and Owen.  
	    “And thanks for being our friend!”  “Bye” said Atticus as he slowly walked back to the barn. <br /> 	    
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Then Owen and Jackson began the long walk back to the cornfield.  
	    The sky was now dark and soon they sat down at the base of the scarecrow.  Looking up at the full 
	    moon above the scarecrows head, Owen remembered the words from the scroll and together 
	    he and Jackson recited them.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Hexus and Nexus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travartis and Gruul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Teach’eth a lesson <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We shan’t learn in school!”<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the scarecrows head looked down at the boys.  His eyes began to glow as he said 
	    “To ’23 you both shall go to share your lesson well ‘bout generations long ago you 
	    now go forth to tell!”  Then the wind began to blow as it did before.  And before long, 
	    both boys traveled back to Jennings Farm and back to year 2023.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Jackson!”   “Owen!” their worried parents yelled from the barn.  
	    “Where have you boys been?  We have been so worried about you!”

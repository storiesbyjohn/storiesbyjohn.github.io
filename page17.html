      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Owen just stared down at the ground for a second and then said 
	    “Oh, Jack and I just wanted to see what Halloween night was like in the Jennings Farm cornfield 
	    and I guess we both fell asleep.  Isn’t that right Jack?” said Owen.  “Yup” said Jack.  
	    “That’s exactly what happened!”   “Well, please don’t ever do something like that again!”  
	    said Jack’s mom.  “Right!” said Owen’s mom.  “Never again!”   “We won’t. 
	    That’s for sure” said Jackson.  “Right Owen?”  “Nope, never again”, said Owen.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbspBut before they began walking over to their parent’s cars, Owen and Jackson 
	    said they needed to do one thing before leaving.  So both boys ran over to the cornfield, 
	    and using the horseshoes as shovels, quickly dug a deep hole and buried the scroll back in the ground.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbspAnd as Jackson and Owen climbed into the back seat of the car, each boy tightly 
	    held on to their horseshoe and would always treasure it and the story they 
	    could tell about their travel back in time and the friend they had met a very long time ago.<br />

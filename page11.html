	<p style="font-size:30px;">  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	“Well ok”, said Atticus.  “Let’s start by grabbing 
		an udder in each hand and milk these cows!”  “Pull up one of them small stools, gently grab hold of an udder, 
		and squeeze down.”  “make sure that all of the milk goes in a milk pail, okay?”<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson gulped and Owen gulped too.  Then they did what Atticus said to do and began milking the cows.  
		And after they had filled each pail, they carefully walked their pail out to a bigger milk can and 
		poured the fresh milk in.<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Atticus then said, “Now that that’s done, we need to go over to the hog stalls and clean them out!”  “Follow me”, 
		said Atticus.  Jack was first to notice the smell, and then Owen smelled it too.  Both boys pinched their 
		nose shut but it did not seem to help.<br />	

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Grab a shovel and a pitchfork”, said Atticus.  “And get all of the old hay and hog waste out of 
		the stalls and into those two wheel barrows.”  “Then we’ll take them over to our vegetable 
		garden and plow it into the soil.”  So Jackson and Owen did what Atticus said to do and filled 
		up the wheelbarrows, dumped them into the garden, and waited to plow it into the soil.

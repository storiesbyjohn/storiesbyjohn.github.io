      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   “But how did you get here?” Atticus asked Owen and Jack.  
	    “Well” said Jackson, “Owen found this old scroll of parchment paper in a cornfield.  
	    And when we took it to someone who could help us understand what the words on the scroll 
	    said, we both hurried out of there and we decided to see if the scroll really had magic 
	    powers to actually transport us back in time.”  “That’s right” said Owen.  
	    “So we went out to a cornfield in our town and sat beneath a spooky scarecrow and read the words 
	    out loud that were written on the scroll… and here we are!”  
	    “But where are we?” asked Owen one more time.
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Atticus looked astonished.  “Well, you’re now in the year 1785 in the town of Evesham 
	    in the free and independent colony of New Jersey. “  “The war for independence from the King of Great Britain ended 
	    just two years ago in 1783 and me and my family have been settled here ever since.”  Atticus continued, “This here’s 
	    the Jennings farmstead and my father and mother own the land that it’s on, all 100 acres of it!”  “It’s a working farm, 
	    so if you boys want to spend the day here, you can.  
	    But be prepared to help out where ever and whenever you’re needed!”
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Owen and Jackson looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders, and said “Sure!  We’ll help!”

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Jack, wait!” Owen yelled.  Jack stopped in his tracks.  “What’s the matter?” Jack asked as he walked back to where Owen was sitting against the stalks of corn.  
	    “Take a look at what I found” said Owen as he handed the scroll over to Jack.  Looking at the scroll, Jack also couldn’t decipher what the words meant.

	The only thing which both boys saw was the date – October 31, 1785. At the top of the scroll.  The rest of the wording seemed to be hand written in some sort of secret coded cursive style of writing.

	“What should we do with it?” Owen asked.  “I know”  said Jack, “Let’s take it to the Medford Historic Society in town and see if anyone there can decipher it for us.”  “Ok” said Owen.

	<p style="font-size:30px;"><i> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Carefully tucking the scroll into his pocket, Owen jumped onto his bike and Jack jumped onto his bike too.  
		Together they rode into town and parked their bikes right in front of the Medford Historical Society and Museum.
    Owen showed the scroll he found to the woman at the front desk.  “oh, wait a minute, you’re going to want to 
	     show it to an expert historian on farming and agriculture- Mr Jennings.”  “He’s actually a distant relative to the family who 
	     owns the farm today.”  
	     “He should be back any minute now, so just have a seat in his office and he’ll be right with you boys.”

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two boys tried not to look at one another.  Averting their gaze at other distractions helped a little – 
        but eventually their eyes met and each boy knew…

    …He knew what they had seen and he knew what had happened -  though no one would ever believe them or the story they would tell.
  
	  But each boy knew the truth about the events that happened on that Halloween night at the old farmstand in Medford, New Jersey, 
      known today as Jennings farm.  </i></p>
	<p style="font-size:30px;"><i> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it was at Jennings Farm on one early Autumn day that Jackson and his friend Owen were wandering across the corn field looking for dried out cobs to toss at one another for fun.  Running around the corn maze and trying to scare each other seemed to be a good game to play, and it was!

	But it as within the corn maze that Owen tripped over what appeared to be a rather large cob of old corn.  It was halfway buried in the ground and he was about to ignore it when he thought that he saw it move.

  	When Owen bent down to pry it out of the ground, the cob opened up to reveal a wrinkled old scroll of paper.  Owen looked over the scroll but he could not make out what was written on it.

	At this time, Jackson found Owen and said “Got you!” and ran away for Owen to try and find him.

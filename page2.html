    <H1>The Scarecrow of Jennings Farm</H1>

    <p><i>
      The two boys tried not to look at one another.  Averting their gaze at other distractions helped a little – 
        but eventually their eyes met and each boy knew…

    …He knew what they had seen and he knew what had happened -  though no one would ever believe them or the story they would tell.
  
	  But each boy knew the truth about the events that happened on that Halloween night at the old farmstand in Medford, New Jersey, 
      known today as Jennings farm.

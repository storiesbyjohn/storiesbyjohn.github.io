      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Owen walked over to the well, lowered the wooden bucket, and raised it back up.  
	After a while, all the plowing was done.  Owen and Jack were drenched with sweat and were totally exhausted.  
	    But the day wasn’t over just yet.  Atticus then said “Let’s go inside the barn; get some milk and bread; 
	    slather some butter and go sit under a shade tree near the house stalls.  Cause after we’ve eaten and rested 
	    for a spell, we need to put some new shoes on some of the horses!”<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Owen walked over to the well, lowered the wooden bucket, and raised it back up.  
	Jackson thought the he mis-heard Atticus, but Owen repeated what Atticus had just said.  “So we’re going to take off 
	    horse shoes and put new shoes on each hoof, right Atticus?” Owen asked.  “Yep!” said Atticus, “and then when that’s 
	    done we’ll need to go to the corn field and plant rows of corn before sundown.  You see, on this farm, 
	    like any farm, you work from dark to dark!”<br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   	Owen walked over to the well, lowered the wooden bucket, and raised it back up.  
	“What do you mean?” asked Owen.  “I know what he means “, said Jack.  “He means that you start working in the dark 
	    before the sun comes up and that you don’t stop until the sun sets and it gets too dark to see.  Right Atticus?”  
	    Atticus just said “Yep, that’s about right.”  Owen and Atticus  and Jack quietly ate their midday meal and after 
	    they were done, walked over to the horse stalls.<br />
